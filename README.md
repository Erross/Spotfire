# Spotfire Scripts
## Javascripts
### Accordion
Accordion.js provides the javascript for building an accordion menu <br>
which will repopulate on refresh in order to 'fix' broken filters which occured<br>
on the change to Spotfire 7.7

### javascript to push button on load
Script will push a button (by spotfire identifier, modify in script) to allow for actions to trigger on load of the text area (this occurs every time the page is navigated to) - good in synchronicity with the screen resolution fixer.py

## PythonScripts
### Change Graph Setup
Change Graph Setup.py provides a generic ironpython script which can be used to
change a graphs x axis properties and title - extensible with other graph related doodads

### Reset Discngine
In order to efficiently use the discngine connector it makes more sense to have each visualization
point to a specific form, rather than use the discngine provided menu structure. In order to do this 
a property must be maintained which keeps this linkage current

### Screen Resolution Fixer
Code to force the display size to be larger than the resolution on monitors where people have decided to run
a 1992 simulator

### Tag rows
Generic Script to tag rows - requires pre defined tags

### Tag rows with free text
Generic Script to tag rows with a user entered free text - defines tags on the fly (requires tag group to exist only)

### Trigger Data Function
Ironpython code to trigger a named data function

### Display altered filters
Ironpython code which will build HTML to inject into a text area (it does this inject) named Show_Filters - only shows modified filters for the filter scheme of the active page.
## R

### regression
This R code snippet will create parameters to use to plot regeression of 2 columns on a graph (intercept and slope of line as outputs)

### supsmu curve
supsu curve function for R in Spotfire - creates a supsmu curve dataset to plot on top of data
## HTML
### Left Side Slideout
